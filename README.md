# Pizza Sales Analysis â€” SQL Project

Welcome to the **Pizza Sales Analysis** project! This project showcases how SQL is used to extract meaningful business insights from a normalized pizza sales dataset. The dataset has been imported from Kaggle and structured into multiple relational tables for optimal querying.

---

## Project Structure

This project includes:

- **Database Schema Creation**
- **13 Business Questions**
- **Data Import**
- **SQL Queries and Insights**

---

## Objective

To analyze a pizza sales dataset using SQL and answer key business questions related to sales performance, customer ordering behavior, and revenue trends.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Database Tool**: MySQL Workbench 
- **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - Pizza Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mdismielhossenabir/pizza-sales-dataset) - manually normalized into a relational format

---

## Business Questions Answered (Using SQL)

### ðŸ”¹ Beginner-Level Analysis:
1. Total number of orders
2. Total revenue generated
3. Highest priced pizza
4. Most common quantity ordered
5. Most common pizza size
6. Top 5 most ordered pizza types (by quantity)

### ðŸ”¹ Intermediate-Level Analysis:
7. Total quantity ordered by each pizza category
8. Order distribution by hour of the day
9. Category-wise pizza distribution 
10. Average number of pizzas ordered per day


 ### ðŸ”¹ Advanced-Level Analysis:
11. Top 3 most ordered pizzas based on revenue
12. Percentage contribution of each category to total revenue
13. Top 3 best-selling pizzas (by revenue) within each category

---

## Key Insights

- The **total revenue** was calculated using `quantity * unit_price`.
- The **most popular pizza size** and **most frequently ordered pizza** were determined via `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`.
- **Window functions (`RANK() OVER`)** were used to rank top pizzas within each category.
- Data was grouped by **hour**, **date**, and **category** to understand trends and optimize business strategy.

---

## Data Cleaning & Transformation

- The original dataset was a **single CSV file**.
- It was split into **four normalized tables** using Excel for efficient relational analysis.
- Temporary tables were used for joining and updating missing fields using SQL joins.

---

## Database Schema

The database consists of 4 tables:

1. ** orders **
   - `order_id` (PK)  
   - `order_date`  
   - `order_time`

2. **order_details**  
   -  
   - `order_id` (FK)  
   - `pizza_id` (FK)  
   - `quantity`

3. **pizzas**  
   - `pizza_id` (PK)  
   - `pizza_type_id` (FK)  
   - `pizza_size`  
   - `unit_price`

4. **pizza_types**  
   - `pizza_type_id` (PK)  
   - `pizza_category`  
   - `pizza_name`  
   - `pizza_ingredients`

---

## Table Creation
```sql
CREATE DATABASE pizza_sales;
USE pizza_sales;
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    order_time TIME,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id)
);
CREATE TABLE order_details (
    order_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    pizza_id INT
);

-- Add pizza_type_id column separately
ALTER TABLE order_details ADD COLUMN pizza_type_id TEXT;

-- Add index for faster join
ALTER TABLE order_details ADD INDEX idx_order_id (order_id);
CREATE TABLE temp_od (
    order_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    pizza_id INT,
    pizza_type_id TEXT
);

-- Add index for faster join
ALTER TABLE temp_od ADD INDEX idx_order_id (order_id);

CREATE TABLE pizzas (
    pizza_id INT,
    pizza_type_id TEXT,
    pizza_size TEXT,
    unit_price DOUBLE
);
CREATE TABLE pizza_types (
    pizza_type_id TEXT,
    pizza_name TEXT,
    pizza_category TEXT,
    pizza_ingredients TEXT
);
```

## Final Thoughts

This project gave me hands-on experience with:
- Writing efficient **SQL queries**.
- Performing **data analysis** using only SQL (no additional libraries/tools).
- Structuring unnormalized data into a **relational schema**.
- Solving real-world business problems using SQL logic.
